# Vectors branch
This branch stores quick, append-only memory notes created from ChatGPT on request ("remember this in my GitHub memory").

## File format
- Path: `vectors/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_note-<id>.txt`
- Content: free-text note + metadata header

## Example trigger
> remember this in my GitHub memory: order Roomba belt kit and test PID fan curve

This will create a new text file in the `vectors` branch.
